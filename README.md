# Introduction
This is just an app for me to keep track of my guitar learning.
Nothing to fancies, I will evolve it as I goes.

## Fundamental:
1. Learn the fretboard
2. Learn the chords
3. Learn the Major and Minor scales
4. Circle of 5th basic reference.

## Feat: Single String practice:
As you run the program, it will randomly asking you to play a note on a certain string.
If you value your practice, you should play a different position everytime.
The string and the note are randomly selected.
As soon as all the diatonic notes on all of the strngs are played, the application will exit.
